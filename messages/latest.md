DistractionFreeWindow (0.6)
===========================

* DistractionFreeWindow now also hides the menu by default when
  DFW mode is enabled. You can change this in your user settings.
* Further enhanced readability of the README by getting rid of
  the table of contents, changing the screencast description and
  updating the docs with new changes to version `0.6`.
* Issue #6 has finally been fixed, sincere apologies to effected
  users! It caused undesired behaviour when switching views within
  a window after having enabled DFW mode and then trying to leave
  it again back to normal mode.
