DistractionFreeWindow (0.6)
===========================

* DistractionFreeWindow now also hides the menu by default when
  switching modes.
* Further enhanced readability of the README by getting rid of
  the table of contents, changing the screencast description and
  updating the docs with new changes to version `0.6`.
